Just walked out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Hurry Up Tomorrow and my brain feels like a spaghetti strainer, all mixed up and letting logic slip through the holes. I mean, what was that?! Was it a ride? A fever dream? I'm not sure if I'm enlightened or just slightly baffled. 

First off, let’s talk about that protagonist. I swear, if I had a nickel for every time they made a decision that made me want to hurl my popcorn at the screen, I'd probably own a yacht by now. But there's something endearingly messy about them too. Like trying to clean up spilled milk with a cinder block. Does that make sense? Whatever, it does in my head. 

> The soundtrack! Oh man, it was like getting stuck in an elevator with a jazz band and a drum circle fighting over the aux cord. And those visuals, wow. At one point, I was pretty sure the screen was 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘬ing colors. Or maybe I just had something weird for lunch, who knows. Stuff jumped around like a cat on a hot tin roof, for better or worse.

And can we talk about that one scene? You know the one. I half-expected unicorns to trot across the background, but instead, it was just...no, I can’t spoil it. Some things you have to witness yourself. 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the movie if you must, but make sure you're wearing your emotional seatbelt.

Someone behind me said it was a commentary on time and existential dread. Well, thank you, Nietzsche, but maybe I just wanted to eat some nachos in peace. 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴 like this make me question if I'm deep or just drowning in shallow water with rocks in my shoes. That’s a metaphor for something, I think.

(function() { alert(Hurry up now!); })();

In the end, did I love it? Did I hate it? I don't think I know yet. It's like probably the movie is still echoing in my skull, like a song you can't get out of your head—that you started off liking but now is driving you utterly bonkers. Worth a 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? Yeah, cause sometimes fuzzy thoughts and crazy visuals are the perfect combo. Guess I’ll understand it all tomorrow. Or maybe, I won't.
